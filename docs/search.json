    "text": "You’ve been tasked with giving a report to Governor Polis each morning about the most current COVID-19 conditions at the county level.\nAs it stands, the Colorado Department of Public Health maintains a watch list of counties that are being monitored for worsening corona virus trends. There are six criteria used to place counties on the watch list:\n1.Doing fewer than 150 tests per 100,000 residents daily (over a 7-day average) 2.More than 100 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past 14 days… 3.25 new cases per 100,000 residents and an 8% test positivity rate 4.10% or greater increase in COVID-19 hospitalized patients over the past 3 days 5.Fewer than 20% of ICU beds available 6.Fewer than 25% ventilators available Of these 6 conditions, you are in charge of monitoring condition number 2.\nTo do this job well, you should set up a reproducible framework to communicate the following in a way that can be updated every time new data is released (daily):\n\ncumulative cases in the 5 worst counties\ntotal NEW cases in the 5 worst counties\nA list of safe counties\nA text report describing the total new cases, total cumulative cases, and number of safe counties. You should build this analysis in such a way that running it will extract the most current data straight from the NY-Times URL and the state name and date are parameters that can be changed allowing this report to be run for other states/dates."
